Clustering Analysis â€“ Customer Segmentation

Description: Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques to group customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to target each segment effectively.


Responsibility: This task involves performing clustering analysis on a dataset to group similar data points based on their features. The process includes loading and inspecting the dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, followed by data preprocessing to standardize feature magnitudes using scalers like StandardScaler. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores, and K-Means Clustering is applied to assign cluster labels. Finally, visualizations such as 2D scatter plots (using PCA or t-SNE) and pair plots are created to analyze and interpret the clusters effectively. The project demonstrates a structured approach to data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization, making it a useful framework for exploratory data analysis and segmentation tasks.
